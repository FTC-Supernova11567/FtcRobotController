/**
 * This file contains an example of an iterative (Non-Linear) "OpMode".
 * An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The names of OpModes appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station.
 * When a selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode
 * class is instantiated on the Robot Controller and executed.
 * <p>
 * This particular OpMode just executes a basic Tank Drive Teleop for a two wheeled robot
 * It includes all the skeletal structure that all iterative OpModes contain.
 * <p>
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list

     * IMPORTANT: You need to obtain your own license key to use Vuforia. The string below with which

     * A Vuforia 'Development' license key, can be obtained free of charge from the Vuforia developer
     * web site at https://developer.vuforia.com/license-manager.
     *
     * Vuforia license keys are always 380 characters long, and look as if they contain mostly
     * random data. As an example, here is a example of a fragment of a valid key:

     * Once you've obtained a license key, copy the string from the Vuforia web site
     * and paste it in to your code on the next line, between the double quotes.
